```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies

$ npm start
```
Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn start
```
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
